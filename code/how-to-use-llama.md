# How to use LLAMA
#### Open the LLAMA editor [here](https://lb123658.github.io/code/) to start. 

#### Commands
LLAMA uses simple commands to run, save, delete, download, import, clear, and print code.\
Commands are formed with: ```cmd --``` followed by the action you want to do.\
For example: ```cmd --run``` would run the code.\
*Commands are always written after the main part of the code*

#### The code
The title of the LLAMA document is written at the top.
```
<file:: LLAMA Example>
```
The code above would set the title of the document to "LLAMA Example".\
The filename part is always at the top.\
To write text in LLAMA use ```create(text) "YOUR TEXT GOES HERE";```
